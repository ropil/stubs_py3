stubs_py3
=========

Standard bioinformatics pipelining stubs for Python (3) scripting (used by me, if none else). Implementing some tricks stumbled upon on the internet.

For your own ease of use; please fork and update with your own name and current year in license/copyleft information.

Cool tricks, additions and derivatives as pull requests are appreciated!
 
## stub_main_only_gpl.py
Simple but older stub that takes some command line arguments using argparse.

Main trick for library dual-acting.

## stub_reading_file_or_stdin_gpl.py
Stub as above, GNU-style; reading either from STDIN or from a list of files, thus enabling seamless shell piping to and from scripts in line.

## Licensing

These code stubs are provided WITHOUT ANY LICENSE.

The licenses here provided is just stock for any work to be made by the stubs and as such DO NOT APPLY TO THE STUBS THEMSELVES; therefore there is no GPL nor CC license on these stubs, they're just for reference.

Thus you are free to use these stubs, adapt them to your own work, all WITHOUT REFERENCING THIS SOURCE.

### CC and GPL?

The idea is to provide a CC license for any non-software publications and a GPL license for derivative softwares. This is to address the issue with interdisciplinary work in applied computer sciences; scientific publications that base their work on using the software should reference the original scientific publication, whilst software derivatives should publish code and software under a copyleft license.

Perhaps this is better regulated with a user agreement for referencing and a GPL license for the code; but then again one would like the two to stick together somehow.
