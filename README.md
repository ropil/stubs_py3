stubs_py3
=========

Standard bioinformatics pipelining stubs for Python (3) scripting (used by me, if none else). Implementing some tricks stumbled upon on the internet.

For your own ease of use; please fork and update with your own name and current year in license/copyleft information.

Cool tricks, additions and derivatives as pull requests are appreciated!
 
## stub_main_only_gpl.py
Simple but older stub that takes some command line arguments using argparse.

Main trick for library dual-acting.

## stub_reading_file_or_stdin_gpl.py
Stub as above, GNU-style; reading either from STDIN or from a list of files, thus enabling seamless shell piping to and from scripts in line.
